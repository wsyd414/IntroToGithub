# Intro To Github

Welcome to class. First things first, let's get to know our tools.
Within the development industry when we build something, we usually build in 
large teams. Powerful programs require many people working on the
project together as a team. A problem that arises when multiple people are working on the same
code in the same project, is that we may change code that affects another contributors code.
That's not good.

In comes version control. Git is an example of a version control system. Version control is 
simply that. Version control systems (VCS's) track and manage the version/state of the source code. 
So we can rewind the history of our code and fastforward to our most recent contribution.

We will also learn a little markdown and a little ruby in the process

No better way to learn than to get started. Clone this repo and follow along.
